# mobile-treasure
App to create SMS and Voice Call-based treasure hunts
I don't have plans to do further development, but it has been used for at least one successful treasure hunt in the wild! I've pushed here in the hope that others might find it useful/entertaining and build upon it.

# Setup
There is no visual interface for editing treasure hunts. In my setup I have it deployed to Heroku and use the free Adminium add-on to allow the stages of the hunt to be edited.
